**Instagram** (commonly abbreviated to **IG,** **Insta** or **the gram**)[[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram#cite_note-9) is an American [photo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo) and [video sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_sharing) [social networking service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking_service) created by [Kevin Systrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Systrom) and [Mike Krieger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Krieger). In April 2012, [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook,_Inc.) acquired the service for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock. The app allows users to upload media that can be edited with [filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_filter) and organized by [hashtags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag) and [geographical tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotag). Posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations and view trending content. Users can [like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_button) photos and follow other users to add their content to a personal [feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_feed).[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram#cite_note-:9-10)

Instagram was originally distinguished by only allowing content to be framed in a square (1:1) [aspect ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)) with 640 pixels to match the display width of the [iPhone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone) at the time. In 2015, these restrictions were eased with an increase to 1080 pixels. The service also added messaging features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single post, and a 'stories' feature—similar to its main opposition [Snapchat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat)—which allows users to post photos and videos to a sequential feed, with each post accessible by others for 24 hours each. As of January 2019, the Stories feature is used by 500 million users daily.[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram#cite_note-:9-10)

Originally launched for [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS) in October 2010, Instagram rapidly gained popularity, with one million registered users in two months, 10 million in a year, and 1 billion as of June 2018.[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram#cite_note-11) The [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) version was released in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited [desktop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer) interface in November 2012, a [Fire OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_OS) app in June 2014, and an app for [Windows 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10) in October 2016. As of October 2015, over 40 billion photos had been uploaded. Although praised for its influence, Instagram has been the subject of criticism, most notably for policy and [interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) changes, allegations of censorship, and illegal or improper content uploaded by users.

The picture currently has over 55 million likes.[[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram#cite_note-13) The second most-liked photo is a wedding photo of [Ariana Grande](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariana_Grande) and her husband Dalton Gomez.[[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram#cite_note-14) Instagram became the 4th most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s.[[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram#cite_note-:8-12)
